  # 3D attenuation rolloff scale. 1 = default physics-inspired falloff.
  # Tune per-project with AudioSource custom curves; keep global sane.
  Rolloff Scale: 1

  # Doppler simulation factor. 0 disables. 1 is physically plausible baseline.
  # Unity docs recommend starting at 1 and tuning with Speed of Sound.
  # See: docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-AudioManager.html
  Doppler Factor: 1

  # Default speaker mode:
  # 2 = Stereo, 3 = Quad, 4 = Surround, 5 = 5.1, 6 = 7.1, per Unity.
  # Stereo is safest default; surround setups will be detected by drivers.
  Default Speaker Mode: 2

  # 0 = Platform default sample rate; set explicit rate for consistency across devices.
  # 48000 is standard for games/VR; reduces SRC cost with most assets.
  m_SampleRate: 48000

  # DSP buffer size in frames. Smaller = lower latency, higher CPU.
  # 256 is a good low-latency target on desktop/console; consider 512 on mobile.
  m_DSPBufferSize: 256

  # Unity will clamp requested buffer to valid sizes; keep this 0 to use m_DSPBufferSize.
  m_RequestedDSPBufferSize: 0

  # Voice counts: virtual voices are mixed conceptually, real voices are hardware-mixed concurrently.
  # Increase real voices for dense scenes; watch CPU/DSP usage.

  # Global audio disable. Keep 0 enabled; gate via code for special builds.
  m_DisableAudio: 0

  # Allow virtualization of effects for offscreen/low-priority sources.
  m_VirtualizeEffects: 1

  # Spatializer plugin (exact name as exposed by the plugin).
  # For Oculus: "OculusSpatializer". For Google Resonance: "ResonanceAudio".
  # Leave empty to use Unity built-in panner (non-HRTF).
  m_SpatializerPlugin: OculusSpatializer

  # Ambisonic decoder plugin.
  # For Oculus: "OculusSpatializer" (enables OculusAmbi). Configure in Project Settings -> Audio.
  # See Meta docs: developers.meta.com/.../audio-osp-unity-ambisonic/
  m_AmbisonicDecoderPlugin: OculusSpatializer

  # Advanced runtime tuning (keys may be editor-version dependent):
  # Global doppler speed of sound in m/s (343 default). Requires engine support/version.
  # If your Unity version exposes these via ProjectSettings, uncomment and set:
  # Speed of Sound: 343
  # DisableAudioDSP: 0

  # Notes for content pipeline:
  # - Use AudioMixer to control buses, ducking, and sends; adjust pitch/ducking per group.
  #   See: docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AudioMixerOverview.html
  # - For spatial audio detail, prefer 48 kHz assets, mono for 3D sources, stereo/ambi for ambiences.
  # - For ambisonics (B-format), import clips as Ambisonic and ensure the chosen decoder is active.
  #   See: developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/audio-osp-unity-ambisonic/
  # - Keep Doppler Factor at 1 globally; adjust per-source Doppler Level and custom rolloff curves.
  #   See: docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-AudioManager.html

  # Safe defaults for project upgrades:
  # If CPU spikes, try:
  #   m_RealVoiceCount: 48
  #   m_DSPBufferSize: 512
  # On high-end/VR rigs, you can push:
  #   m_RealVoiceCount: 96
  #   m_DSPBufferSize: 256 or 128 (test crackle/underruns)
